'''1.	Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 
but are not amultiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). 
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. 
Solution: '''

number = list(range(2000,3201))
output = [i for i in number if (i % 7 == 0) and (i % 5 != 0)]
print(output)

''' 2.	Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them
printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name. 
Solution: '''

Firstname = input("Enter you first name:")
Lastname = input("Enter you last name:")
print(Lastname, Firstname)


'''3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
 
Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 

Solution: '''

r = 12
pi = 22/7
V = 4/3 * pi * (r ** 3)
print("The volumne of sphere of a sphere with diameter",r,"cm is:", V)
